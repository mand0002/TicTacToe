# TicTacToe
This is a 2D tic tac toe game I created to practice some of my React skills using useState, mounting and unmountingFut
You can play this game by picking a square and it will place an X, then it switches players and the next square will have an O.  If you get three in a row, you win.
Technologies: Javascript, React
Future improvements: get it to find winner.js, add feature that asks you to restart the game when there is a winner and prevent you from continuing to click on squares after winning.
